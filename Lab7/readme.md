### Question 3
The default constructor is called when the call would go out for a constructor that does not existed. It has zero parameters and shouldn’t even be used intentionally.  
### Question 4
The concept is called Constructor Overloading. Constructor overloading is when you create multiple constructors with the same name, but with different parameters. 
### Question 5
Exception Handling allows use to find errors in our program while still being able to run it. The try, catch, and finally keywords allow you to try actions that may not succeed, to handle failures when you decide that it is reasonable to do so, and to clean up resources afterward. 
### Question 6
The purpose of private vs public is to determine what information should be shared and what should be kept a secret. Private serves to restrict information that can’t be tampered with. Public is for information that needs to be shared throughout the program.  
### Question 7
Composition is when a class has objects of value types or references to objects of other classes as members. This could be used in out book class to pull the names of our title and other varibles from the class BookTest.  
### Question 8
Data abstraction is used to hide the implementation details and display only essential features of the object. This means that you can hide certain parts of code that you don’t want people to see. This is mainly done in objects using the private keyword. The good thing is not everything in an object has to be private, only the parts you want.
